## Documentation
The **DispatcherServlet** is acts as a front controller like it provides a single entry point for a client request to Spring MVC web application and forwards request to Spring MVC controllers for processing.

The **DispatcherServlet** is an actual *Servlet* (in inherits from the HttpServlet Base class).

**A handler method** is a method in Java class that handles incoming HTTP requests.

**JPA** is a Java specification that gives some functionality and standard to **ORM** tools. It is used to examine, control, and persist data between Java objects and relational databases. It is observed as a standard technique for Object Relational Mapping. It is considered as a link between an **object-oriented model** and a relational database system.
**JPA** is described in javax.persistence package.

**Hibernate** is a java framework, open-source, lightweight, and ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool for the java language which simplifies the buildout of Java application to interact with the database. It is used to save the Java objects in the relational database system.

The main **feature of Hibernate** is to map the Java classes to database tables. 
Following are some key features of Hibernate:
* Hibernate is an implementation of JPA guidelines.
* It helps in mapping Java data types to SQL data types.
* It is the contributor of JPA.
